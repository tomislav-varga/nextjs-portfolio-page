            I retrained to start my career in IT as a Windows IT Support Specialist, where I built a strong foundation in troubleshooting, customer support, and system administration. Along the way, I discovered a passion for programming and Linux, which inspired me to transition into DevOps and software development.

            My journey into tech has also been a personal oneâ€”I overcame challenges in my past, which taught me resilience, discipline, and the importance of continuous growth. I now apply these qualities to my work in IT and my ongoing path toward becoming a DevOps engineer.
