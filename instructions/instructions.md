**📁 File Structure (Strictly Follow)**

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── globals.css
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   └── page.tsx
├── components/
│   ├── layout/
│   └── ui/
├── lib/
└── styles/

```

**📜 Rules**

1. All **components** go in the /components directory.

• Naming convention: example-component.tsx

2. All **pages** go in the /app directory.

3. **Work incrementally**:

• Clearly state the **goal** of each step.

• Explain **why** the step is important.

• After implementation, **summarize** what was achieved.

• Cleanly **transition** to the next step.
